OM 
I bow to the two lotus feet of the Gurus which awaken insight into the happiness of pure Being, 
which are the refuge, the jungle physician, which eliminate the delusion caused by the 
poisonous herb of Samara (conditioned existence)
I prostrate before the 
sage Patanjali who has thousands of radiant, white heads (as the divine 
serpent, Ananta) and who has, as far as his arms, assumed the form of a man holding a conch 
shell (divine sound), a wheel (discus of light or infinite time) and a sword (discrimination
) 
OM

  我虔诚地向我最尊敬的导师俯身祈祷，他传授我知识，唤起我内心的巨大的快乐。他像一名丛林医生，能祛除在某种情况下由于存在毒素而生的幻念。帕坦加力(Patanjali)，阿迪塞萨(Adisesa)的化身，他有白色的肌肤，长着一千个向四方延展的头(外形如蛇神)，人身；手举一把歧视之剑，一个象征无穷时间的火轮和一个象征给他神的声音的海螺。我俯身致敬。
